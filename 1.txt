1. What is MATLAB:
    MATLAB is an environment for all kinds of technical computing, like data analysis, simulation and algorithm development.

Theoretical model that says what the energy production should be:
latitude = 42 + 17/60 // 42Â° 17'
solarDeclination
LST: local solar time
sin(alpha) = sin(solarDeclination) * sin(latitude) + cos(solarDeclination) * cos(latitude) * cos(15 * (LST - 12))
