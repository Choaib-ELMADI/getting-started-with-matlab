1. Why & Where are Monte Carlo Simulations used?
    ==> Monte Carlo Simulations help to answer probability questions
    ==> Used for example in:
        - Finance (economic forecasting, risk management, stress testing, ...)
        - Automotive (sensitivity analyses, ...)
        - Weather Forecasting
        - ...

2. What are Monte Carlo Simulations?
    ==> Repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results

    1. Start with a simulation model
    2. Run that model many times with randomly changing parameters
    3. Analyze the results systematially
